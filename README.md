# EHR-HeaderDetector-AnnotationAnalyser: Electronic Health Record (EHR) Header Detector and Annotation Analyser #



## Introduction

This project is about (pre-)annotation of section headers in EHR. It includes different scripts to: 
(i) annotate and normalize section headers in EHR, 
(ii) generate statistical analysis on the annotated files, 
(iii) merge the annotations in BRAT and 
(iv) to monitor and assess the eventual manual annotation task done on the pre-annotated documents.

These scripts were used to identify and normalise section headers in discharge reports. 
The generated annotations can be loaded in the BRAT tool and merged with additional annotations.
Once all annotations are loaded in BRAT, expert humans can do the eventual 
manual annotation (by validating and/or editing the automatic pre-annotations). 
The project includes script that computes intera-annotation agreement (IAA) and 
compares the pre-annotations with the eventual manual annotations to monitor the human annotation task.


## Directory structure

- [**`scripts/`**](scripts/): 
This folder contains the scripts needed to detect headers, calculate statistical analysis of headers 
and compraing different annotations records (that has been done by different annotators) for a same file
and finally comparing the manually annotated files with pre-annotated files by [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS).

  - [**`header_detector.py`**](script/header_detector.py): For detecting headers of EHR (Electronich Health Records). 
	We need the list of headers that is available of [data directory](data/). 
	Input is [TXT files](documents/TXT) and 
	output is [XML files](documents/XML_SECTION) and [BRAT files (ANN)](documents/ANN_SECTION) .

  - [**`parser.py`**](script/parser.py): For calulating statistical analysis on the headers of XML files (output of header_detector.py).
	Input is [XML files](documents/XML_SECTION) and output is CSV and PNG in analysis_headers directory.
	analysis_headers folder will be create after running "parser" script.

  - [**`concatenate.py`**](script/concatenate.py): For concatenating outout of header_detector (ANN files in root/documents/ANN_SECTION) with
	output of [pre_annotated files --BRAT files (ANN)](documents/ANN_VARIABLE) of [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS).
	Output of this script will be [ANN_FINAL](documents/ANN_FINAL).

  - [**`comparing_ann.py`**](script/comparing_ann.py):: For
  	1) comparing the activity of annotators with together. 
	   Output of this part will be saved [IAA files](Annotated/IAA),
 	   which are ANN files with all acitivity of all annotators for given files
	   and [CSV Directory](Annotated/post_processing_csv), which acitivities of all annotators 
	   have been shown for all annotated tokens.
	2) Comparing the manually [annotated files](Annotated/annotators) with [pre-annotated file](Annotated/cTAKES) by [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS)
	   For detecing which pre-annoted variables have been changed, accepted, removed and 
	   which variables have been added by annotators.
	   Also calulate statistical analysis on how many variables have been added/accepted/changed/removed.
	   Output of this part will be saved at [analysis](Annotated/analysis)

	**Note**: All output directories of this part will be created after running this script
    
- [**`data/`**](data/)
This folder contains relevant information for the conversion process:

  - **headers.txt**: This file contains a list of allowed headers for your EHRs. The 
  normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list.
  - **importat_headers.txt**: This file contains a list of needed headers for doing statistical analysis.

- [**`documents/`**](documents/)
  - [**`txt/`**](documents/txt/): Text files directory, this folder can have several sub-direcotries for each annotator
	and it is mandatory that each annotator has sub-directory for difference bunch

	Example of format of TXT directory (All other directories in documents also follow this format):
    ```
	- TXT/
	  - Annotator1/
	    - 01/
	      - file1.txt
	      - file2.txt
	      - ...
	    - 02/
	      - file4.txt
	      - file5.txt
	      - ...
	    - ...

	  - Annotator2/
	    - 01/
	      - file3.txt
	      - file2.txt
	      - ...
	    - 02/
	      - file6.txt
	      - file7.txt
	      - ...
	    - ...
	  - ...
    ```

  - [**`XML_SECTION/`**](documents/XML_SECTION/): Output of header_detector.py script
  - [**`ANN_SECTION/`**](documents/ANN_SECTION/): Output of header_detector.py script and input for concatenate.py script
  - [**`ANN_VARIABLE/`**](documents/ANN_VARIABLE/): Output of [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS), which would be ANN files and input for concatenate.py script
  - [**`ANN_FINAL/`**](documents/ANN_FINAL/): Outout of concatenate.py script

- [**`analysis_headers/`**](analysis_headers/)
This folder will be create after running "parser" script.
and it contains the result (Plot and CVS) of statiscial analysis based on the detected headers.
  -  [**`PLOT/`**](analysis_headers/PLOT/):
	Showing how many headers we detec on the given corpus
  -  [**`CSV/`**](analysis_headers/CSV/):
	{Corpus-Name}_analysis_files.csv: Showing all detected headers in each text file. 
	{Corpus-Name}_analysis_headers.csv: Showing all files that contain a specefic header. 
	{Corpus-Name}_analysis_header_co-occurrence.csv: Is it a matrix which showing how many times two headers co-occurrened
	{Corpus-Name}_analysis_original_headers_in_report.csv: Showing the original text in the EHR that script detect it as a header (By similarity method) 

- [**`Annotated/`**](Annotated/)
This folder contains the results of compraing different annotations records (that has been done by different annotators) 
for a same file and comparing the manually annotated files with pre-annotated files by [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS).

  - [**`annotators/`**](Annotated/annotators/): original files for each annotator.
  - [**`pre_processing/`**](Annotated/pre_processing/): directory for cleaned ANN files after removing un-necassery annotations.
  - [**`IAA/`**](Annotated/IAA/):  Result of comparing annotators' acitivies in ANN files (ANN files with all acitivity of all annotators for given files)
  - [**`post_processing_csv/`**](Annotated/post_processing_csv/):  Result of comparing annotators' activities in csv files
    (acitivities of all annotators have been shown for all annotated tokens).
  - [**`analysis/`**](Annotated/analysis/): Comparing the manually [annotated files](Annotated/annotators) with [pre-annotated file](Annotated/cTAKES) by [SpaCTeS tool](https://github.com/siabar/SpaCTeS)
    For detecing which pre-annoted variables have been changed, accepted, removed and 
    which variables have been added by annotators.
    Also calulate statistical analysis on how many variables have been added/accepted/changed/removed.
