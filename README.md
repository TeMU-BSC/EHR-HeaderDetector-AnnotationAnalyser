# EHR-HeaderDetector: Electronic Health Record (EHR) Header Detector     



## Introduction
------------

This script performs EHR normalization by detecting headers from documents and mapping those sections into any desired archetype. It can also restore the lines that have been truncated by a conversion process from the original document to txt.
The detected headers also will save in a BRAT file with their begin and end spans.

Alos there is a script for doing statistical analysis on the detected headers in the given corpus.


## Directory structure
-------------------

<pre>
data/
This folder contains relevant information for the conversion process:

  - headers.txt: This file contains a list of allowed headers for your EHRs. The 
  normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list.
  - importat_headers.txt: This file contains a list of needed headers for doing statistical analysis.


documents/
Default root folder of source TXT files. It is mandatory to place all your TXT
files inside a "TXT-{Corpus Name}" folder. Your "TXT-{Corpus Name}" folder can be TXT files from different corpora 
  - Note: Replace {Corpus Name} wit the name of corpus, For Instance "TXT-SonEspases"

Output XML and BRAT files are stored in "XML-{Corpus Name}" and "BRAT-{Corpus Name}" folders.
  - Note: Replace {Corpus Name} wit the name of corpus, For Instance "BRAT-SonEspases"


scripts/
This folder contains the scripts needed to detect headers, calculate statistical analysis and compraing different annotations records (that has been done by different annotators) for a same file.

analysis/
This folder contains the result (Plot and CVS) of statiscial analysis based on the detected headers.
  - PLOT/
  Showing how many headers we detec on the given corpus
  - CVS/
  {Corpus-Name}_analysis_files.csv: Showing all detected headers in each text file. 
  {Corpus-Name}_analysis_headers.csv: Showing all files that contain a specefic header. 
  {Corpus-Name}_analysis_header_co-occurrence.csv: Is it a matrix which showing how many times two headers co-occurrened
  {Corpus-Name}_analysis_original_headers_in_report.csv: Showing the original text in the EHR that script detect it as a header (By similarity method) 

\Annotated/
This folder contains the result of the annotators that manually annotate/modify the output of the EHR-HeaderDetector script. There are 4 subdirectories, 
  - original: original files for each annotator.
  - pre-processing: (For removing un-necassery annotations)
  - post_processing_csv:  Result of comparing in csv format 
  - post_processing_ann:  Result of comparing in ann file.

## Usage
-----

For Detecting Header we use this commad:

	Python3 header-detector.py [options] 

Options:
<pre>
-c      Type of Corpus [For example: Aquas or SonEspases]
</pre>


For statistical Analysis of headers we use this commad:

	Python3 parser.py [options] 

Options:
<pre>
--filter     Filter files based on needed headers
--strict     Show just analysis of filtered headers
-c      Type of Corpus [For example: Aquas or SonEspases]
</pre>


For concatenate two ann files to together. 
	python3 concatenate.py [options] 

Options:
<pre>
-c      Type of Corpus [For example: Aquas or SonEspases]
</pre>
